"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Do perform spin-component-scaled OMP2 (SCS-OMP2)? In all computation, SCS-OMP2 energy is computed automatically. However, in order to perform geometry optimizations and frequency computations with SCS-OMP2, one needs to set 'DO_SCS' to true

      * **Type**: :ref:`boolean <op_c_boolean>`
      * **Default**: false
