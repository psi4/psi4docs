:term:`DAMPING_PERCENTAGE <DAMPING_PERCENTAGE (PSIMRCC)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      The amount (percentage) of damping to apply to the amplitude updates. 0 will result in a full update, 100 will completely stall the update. A value around 20 (which corresponds to 20\% of the amplitudes from the previous iteration being mixed into the current iteration) can help in cases where oscillatory convergence is observed.

      * **Type**: double
      * **Default**: 0.0
