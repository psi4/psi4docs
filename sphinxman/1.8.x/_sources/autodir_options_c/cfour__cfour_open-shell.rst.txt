:term:`CFOUR_OPEN-SHELL <CFOUR_OPEN-SHELL (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies which kind of open-shell CC treatment is employed. The default is a spin-orbital CC treatment (SPIN-ORBITAL =1) which is the only possible choice for UHF-CC schemes anyways. For ROHF-CC treatments, the possible options are beside the standard spin-orbital scheme a spin-restricted CC approach (SR-CC=3), as well as a corresponding linear approximation (which in the literature usually is referred to as partially-spin-adapted CC scheme) (PSA-CC=1). SR-CC and PSA-CC are within the CCSD approximation restricted to excitations defined by the first-order interacting space arguments. With the keywords PSA-CC_FULL (=2) or SR-CC_FULL (=6) inclusion of the so called "pseudo-triples" beyond the first-order interacting space is also possible. The two-determinant CC method for open-shell singlet states can be activated by TD-CC (=8).

      * **Type**: string
