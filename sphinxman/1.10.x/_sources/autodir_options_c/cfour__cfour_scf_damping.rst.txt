:term:`CFOUR_SCF_DAMPING <CFOUR_SCF_DAMPING (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Controls the damping (in the first iterations (specified by :term:`CFOUR_SCF_EXPSTART <CFOUR_SCF_EXPSTART (CFOUR)>` via :math:`D_{new} = D_{old} + X/1000 * (D_{new} - D_{old})` with :math:`X` as the value specified by the keyword. The default value is currently 1000 (no damping), but a value of 500 is recommended in particular for transition metal compounds where the SCF convergence is often troublesome. **Psi4 Interface:** Keyword subject to translation from value of :term:`DAMPING_PERCENTAGE <DAMPING_PERCENTAGE (SCF)>` unless set explicitly.

      * **Type**: integer
      * **Default**: 1000
