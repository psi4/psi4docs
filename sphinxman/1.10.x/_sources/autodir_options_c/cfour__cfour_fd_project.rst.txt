"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies whether or not rotational degrees of freedoms are projected out from the symmetry-adapted coordinates in a finite difference calculations. ON (=0) uses rotationally projected coordinates, while OFF (=1) retains the rotational degrees of freedom. At a stationary point on the potential energy surface, both options will give equivalent harmonic force fields, but OFF should be used at non-stationary points.

      * **Type**: string
      * **Possible Values**: ON, OFF
      * **Default**: ON
