:term:`CFOUR_EVAL_HESS <CFOUR_EVAL_HESS (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Tells the program, in the course of a geometry optimization, to calculate the Hessian explicitly every N cycles. 0 means never calculated explicitly. **Psi4 Interface:** Geometry optimizations run through PSI (except in sandwich mode) use PSI's optimizer and so this keyword has no effect. Use :ref:`optking <apdx:optking>` keywords instead, particularly :py:attr:`~optking.v1.optparams.OptParams.full_hess_every`.

      * **Type**: integer
