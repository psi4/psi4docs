:term:`DAMPING_PERCENTAGE <DAMPING_PERCENTAGE (DCT)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      The amount (percentage) of damping to apply to the orbital update procedure: 0 will result in a full update, 100 will completely stall the update. A value around 20 (which corresponds to 20\% of the previous iteration's density being mixed into the current iteration) can help in cases where oscillatory convergence is observed. 

      * **Type**: double
      * **Default**: 0.0
