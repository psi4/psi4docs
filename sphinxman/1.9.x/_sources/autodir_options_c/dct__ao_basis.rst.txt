:term:`AO_BASIS <AO_BASIS (DCT)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Controls whether to avoid the AO->MO transformation of the two-electron integrals for the four-virtual case (\ :math:`\langle VV|| VV \rangle`\ ) by computing the corresponding terms in the AO basis. AO_BASIS = DISK algorithm reduces the memory requirements and can significantly reduce the cost of the energy computation if SIMULTANEOUS algorithm is used. For the TWOSTEP algorithm, however, AO_BASIS = DISK option is not recommended due to extra I/O.
