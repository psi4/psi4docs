:term:`DAMPING_PERCENTAGE <DAMPING_PERCENTAGE (SCF)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      The amount (percentage) of damping to apply to the early density updates. 0 will result in a full update, 100 will completely stall the update. A value around 20 (which corresponds to 20\% of the previous iteration's density being mixed into the current density) could help to solve problems with oscillatory convergence.

      * **Type**: double
      * **Default**: 0.0
