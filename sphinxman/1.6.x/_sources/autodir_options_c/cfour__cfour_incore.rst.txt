:term:`CFOUR_INCORE <CFOUR_INCORE (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      This keyword can be used to significantly reduce disk i/o, and should be implemented very soon. The following options are available: OFF (= 0), no special algorithms are used (the default case); ALL (=1) all quantities except the :math:`\langle ab\vert\vert cd\rangle` molecular integral lists are held in core; PARTIAL (= 2), the T2 and T1 vectors are held in core throughout the calculation; (=4) all quantities except the :math:`\langle ab\vert\vert cd\rangle` and :math:`\langle ab\vert\vert ci\rangle` integrals are held in core; (=5) :math:`\langle ij\vert\vert kl\rangle` and :math:`\langle ij\vert\vert ka\rangle` and two-index quantities are held in core; (=6) all direct access files (``MOINTS``, ``GAMLAM``, etc.) are held in core. At present, these options have been implemented only in the energy code ``xvcc`` and the excitation energy code ``xvee``. (Default: 0)

      * **Type**: string
