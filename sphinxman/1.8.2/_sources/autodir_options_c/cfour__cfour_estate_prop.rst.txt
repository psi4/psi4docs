"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      This keyword applies only to EOM-CC calculations and specifies whether any excited or ionized state one-electron properties are to be calculated. Proper use of this keyword requires a relatively advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry and the available options are discussed here. The options are: OFF (=0) [no properties or transition moments are calculated]; EXPECTATION (=1) [transition moments and dipole strengths are calculated along with selected one-electron properties which are evaluated as expectation values]; UNRELAXED (=2) [selected one-electron properties are calculated in an approximation that neglects relaxation of molecular orbitals]; RESPONSE (=3) [selected one-electron properties are calculated as analytic first derivatives of the energy]. Except for EOMCC calculations on two-electron systems (which are exact), properties obtained by the three approaches will not be equivalent. The default value for this keyword is slightly complicated. For TDA calculations, the default is EXPECTATION since the evaluation of transition moments involves only a negligible amount of additional computation relative to the evaluation of the excitation energies. For EOMCC, the default is OFF since evaluation of any transition moments or properties requires approximately twice the computational time. Transition moments and dipole strengths are evaluated by default for all values of ESTATE_PROP other than OFF.
