:term:`CFOUR_RESTART_CC <CFOUR_RESTART_CC (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Offers the possibility to restart a CC calculation which stopped for various reasons, e.g. time limit, in the correlation part. However, note that a restart which is specified by ON (= 1) needs the following files of the previous unfinished calculation: ``JOBARC``, ``JAINDX``, ``MOINTS``, and ``MOABCD``.
