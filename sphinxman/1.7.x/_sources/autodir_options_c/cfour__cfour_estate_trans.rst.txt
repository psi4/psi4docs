:term:`CFOUR_ESTATE_TRANS <CFOUR_ESTATE_TRANS (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies whether just the excitation energies (OFF, =0) or in addition transition moments (EXPECTATION, =1) are calculated. Note that this keyword should not be used in excited-state calculations involving analytic gradients and that transition moments are essentially only available for EOM-CCSD/CCSD-LR.

      * **Type**: string
      * **Possible Values**: OFF, EXPECTATION
      * **Default**: OFF
