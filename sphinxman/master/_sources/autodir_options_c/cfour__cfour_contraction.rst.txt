:term:`CFOUR_CONTRACTION <CFOUR_CONTRACTION (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies the contraction scheme used by the integral and integral derivative program. SEGMENTED (=0) uses a segmented contraction scheme; GENERAL (=1) uses a general contraction scheme, and UNCONTRACTED (=2) uses the corresponding uncontracted sets. Note that even for truly segmented basis sets, the integral programs run significantly faster in the GENERAL mode.
