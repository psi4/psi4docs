:term:`CACHELEVEL <CACHELEVEL (CCLAMBDA)>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Caching level for libdpd governing the storage of amplitudes, integrals, and intermediates in the CC procedure. A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache, while a level of 6 attempts to store all quantities in cache. For particularly large calculations, a value of 0 may help with certain types of memory problems. The default is 2, which means that all four-index quantities with up to two virtual-orbital indices (e.g., :math:`\left\langle ij | ab \right\rangle` integrals) may be held in the cache.

      * **Type**: integer
      * **Default**: 2
