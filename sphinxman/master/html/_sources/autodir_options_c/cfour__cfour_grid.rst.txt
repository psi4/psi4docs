Options are OFF (=0), no grid calculation; CARTESIAN (=1), steps are in Cartesian coordinates (which must be run with :term:`CFOUR_COORDINATES <CFOUR_COORDINATES (CFOUR)>` =CARTESIAN); INTERNAL (=2), steps are in Z-matrix internal coordinates; QUADRATURE (=3) steps are chosen for an integration based on Gauss-Hermite quadrature. (Default: OFF)

      * **Type**: string
