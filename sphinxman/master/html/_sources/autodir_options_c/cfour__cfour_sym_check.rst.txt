      In principle can be used to force the SCF to converge a solution for which the density matrix transforms as the totally symmetric representation of the point group (i.e. no broken symmetry solutions). The code seems to work in most cases, but has currently been implemented for point groups with E type representation and not for those with triply-, quadruply- or pentuply-degenerate representations. Extending the code to those cases is probably straightforward, and the reader is encouraged to do so if (s)he is so inclined. SYM_CHECK=0 "forces" the high-symmetry solution. SYM_CHECK=OVERRIDE (=1) doesn't. The latter is the default.
