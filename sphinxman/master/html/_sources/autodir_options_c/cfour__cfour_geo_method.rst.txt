:term:`CFOUR_GEO_METHOD <CFOUR_GEO_METHOD (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies the used geometry optimization methods. The following values are permitted: NR (=0) --- straightforward Newton-Raphson search for minimum; RFA (=1) --- Rational Function Approximation search for minimum (this method can be used to find minima when the initial structure is in a region where the Hessian index is nonzero); TS (=2) Cerjan-Miller eigenvector following search for a transition state (can be started in a region where the Hessian index is not equal to unity); MANR (=3) --- Morse-adjusted Newton-Raphson search for minimum (very efficient minimization scheme, particularly if the Hessian is available); SINGLE_POINT (=5) for a single-point energy calculation. ENERONLY (=6) requests a geometry optimization based on single-point energy calculations. Default: SINGLE-POINT (NR as soon as variables are marked to be optimized).

      * **Type**: string
      * **Possible Values**: NR, RFA, TS, MANR, SINGLE\_POINT, ENERONLY
      * **Default**: SINGLE\_POINT
