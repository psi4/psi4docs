:term:`TDSCF_STATES <TDSCF_STATES (SCF)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Number of roots (excited states) we should seek to converge. This can be either an integer (total number of states to seek) or a list (number of states per irrep). The latter is only valid if the system has symmetry. Furthermore, the total number of states will be redistributed among irreps when symmetry is used.

      * **Type**: array
      * **Default**: No Default
