:term:`EOM_GUESS <EOM_GUESS (CCEOM)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies a set of single-excitation guess vectors for the EOM-CC procedure. If EOM_GUESS = ``SINGLES``, the guess will be taken from the singles-singles block of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, Hbar. If EOM_GUESS = ``DISK``, guess vectors from a previous computation will be read from disk. If EOM_GUESS = ``INPUT``, guess vectors will be specified in user input. The latter method is not currently available.

      * **Type**: string
      * **Possible Values**: SINGLES, DISK, INPUT
      * **Default**: SINGLES
