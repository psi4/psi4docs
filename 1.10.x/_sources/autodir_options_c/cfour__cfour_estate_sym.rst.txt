:term:`CFOUR_ESTATE_SYM <CFOUR_ESTATE_SYM (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies the number of excited states which are to be determined in each irreducible representation of the computational subgroup. The program attempts to find all of the lowest roots, but this is not guaranteed because the eigenvalue problem is not solved by direct matrix diagonalization, but rather by an iterative (modified Davidson) algorithm. For excited state gradient calculations, only one root (clearly) is used. In such a case, one and only one non-zero entry in the string can be used, and this value is usually set to one (*i.e.* 0/1/0/0). (However sometimes one wants to calculate the gradient for, say, the second root of a given symmetry, and in such a case, one could use 0/2/0/0. What happens is that both roots are calculated, but only the second one is used in the subsequent density matrix and gradient calculation.) The format used for this keyword is identical to that used in :term:`CFOUR_OCCUPATION <CFOUR_OCCUPATION (CFOUR)>`  For example, for a computational subgroup having four symmetry species, the string 3/1/0/2 specifies that 6 total roots should be searched for, three in the first block, one in the second block, and two in the fourth block. It is also important to note that the ``%excite*`` input, if present, takes precedence over this keyword. Default: All zeros. **Psi4 Interface:** The array above is specified in PSI as (white space tolerant) [3,1,0,2].
