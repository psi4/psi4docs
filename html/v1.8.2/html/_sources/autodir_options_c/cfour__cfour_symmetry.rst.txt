:term:`CFOUR_SYMMETRY <CFOUR_SYMMETRY (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies what subgroup of the full point group is to be used in the energy and/or gradient calculation (the computational point group). OFF (=1) forces a no symmetry run (in :math:`C_1` ) and ON (=0) runs the calculation in the largest self-adjoint subgroup ( :math:`D_{2h}` and its subgroups).
