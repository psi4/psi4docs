:term:`INTS_TOLERANCE <INTS_TOLERANCE (SAPT)>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Schwarz screening threshold. Minimum absolute value below which all three-index DF integrals and those contributing to four-index integrals are neglected. The default is conservative, but there isn't much to be gained from loosening it, especially for higher-order SAPT.
