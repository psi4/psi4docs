:term:`EXCITATION_RANGE <EXCITATION_RANGE (CCEOM)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      The depth into the occupied and valence spaces from which one-electron excitations are seeded into the Davidson guess to the CIS (the default of 2 includes all single excitations between HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1). This CIS is in turn the Davidson guess to the EOM-CC. Expand to capture more exotic excited states in the EOM-CC calculation 

      * **Type**: integer
      * **Default**: 2
