:term:`TDM <TDM (DETCI)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Do compute the transition density? Note: only transition densities between roots of the same symmetry will be evaluated. DETCI does not compute states of different irreps within the same computation; to do this, lower the symmetry of the computation.
