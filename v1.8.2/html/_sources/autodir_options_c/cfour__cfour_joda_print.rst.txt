:term:`CFOUR_JODA_PRINT <CFOUR_JODA_PRINT (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Controls amount of debug printing performed by ``xjoda``. The higher the number, the more information is printed. Values of 25 or higher generally do not produce anything of interest to the general user. Do not set JODA_PRINT to 999 as this will cause the core vector to be dumped to disk.

      * **Type**: integer
