:term:`BENDAZZOLI <BENDAZZOLI (DETCI)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Do use some routines based on the papers of Bendazzoli et al. to calculate sigma? Seems to be slower and not worthwhile; may disappear eventually. Works only for full CI and I don't remember if I could see how their clever scheme might be extended to RAS in general.
