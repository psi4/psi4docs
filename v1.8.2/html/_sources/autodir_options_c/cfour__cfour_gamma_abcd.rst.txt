:term:`CFOUR_GAMMA_ABCD <CFOUR_GAMMA_ABCD (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Used to control the handling and storage of two-particle density matrix elements with four virtual indices :math:`\Gamma(abcd)`. DISK (=0) directs the program to calculate and store all elements of :math:`\Gamma(abcd)`, while DIRECT (=1) tells the program to use alternative algorithms in which :math:`\Gamma(abcd)` is calculated and used "on the fly". Note that this option might be not available for all type of calculations.

      * **Type**: string
      * **Possible Values**: DISK, DIRECT
      * **Default**: DISK
