:term:`CFOUR_T3_EXTRAPOL <CFOUR_T3_EXTRAPOL (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies whether the T3 amplitudes are included ON (=1) or not included OFF (=0) in the DIIS convergence acceleration during CCSDT calculations. Inclusion of T3 speeds up convergence and allows tight convergence, but on the other hand it increases disk space requirements. Note that this keyword is only available with module ``xecc``.
