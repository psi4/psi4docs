"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies whether and which molecular property is calculated. OFF (=0) means that no property is calculated, FIRST_ORDER (=1) requests computation of various one-electron first-order properties (e.g., dipole moment, quadrupole moment, electric field gradient, spin densities,etc.), SECOND_ORDER (=2, in the next release replaced by STAT_POL) computes static electric polarizabilities, DYNAMICAL (=7, in the next release replaced by DYN_POL) requests the calculation of frequency-dependent polarizabilities (note that here an additional input of the frequency is required), NMR (=5) requests the calculation of NMR chemical shifts/chemical shielding tensors (by default using GIAOs), J_FC requests the calculation of the Fermi-Contact contribution to indirect spin-spin coupling constants, J_SD the calculation of the corresponding spin-dipole contribution, and J_SO the calculation of the corresponding spin-orbit contribution to J; HYPERPOL (=22) invokes a calculation of static hyperpolarizabilities, DYN_HYP (=23) requests the calculation of frequency-dependent hyperpolarizabilities, SHG (=24) the calculation of hyperpolarizabilities related to the second-harmonic generation, OPT_REC (=25) the computation of hyperpolarizabilities related to optical rectification, VERDET (=26) the calculation of Verdet constants.
