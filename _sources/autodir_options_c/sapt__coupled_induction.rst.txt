:term:`COUPLED_INDUCTION <COUPLED_INDUCTION (SAPT)>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Solve the CPHF equations to compute coupled induction and exchange-induction. These are not available for ROHF, and the option is automatically false in this case. In all other cases, coupled induction is strongly recommended. Only turn it off if the induction energy is not going to be used.
