:term:`FILTER_GUESS <FILTER_GUESS (DETCI)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Do invoke the FILTER_GUESS options that are used to filter out some trial vectors which may not have the appropriate phase convention between two determinants? This is useful to remove, e.g., delta states when a sigma state is desired. The user inputs two determinants (by giving the absolute alpha string number and beta string number for each), and also the desired phase between these two determinants for guesses which are to be kept. FILTER_GUESS = TRUE turns on the filtering routine. Requires additional keywords :term:`FILTER_GUESS_DET1 <FILTER_GUESS_DET1 (DETCI)>`  :term:`FILTER_GUESS_DET2 <FILTER_GUESS_DET2 (DETCI)>`  and :term:`FILTER_GUESS_SIGN <FILTER_GUESS_SIGN (DETCI)>`
