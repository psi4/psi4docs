:term:`TDSCF_TRIPLETS <TDSCF_TRIPLETS (SCF)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Controls inclusion of triplet states, which is only valid for restricted references. Valid options: - none : No triplets computed (default) - also : lowest-energy triplets and singlets included, in 50-50 ratio. Note that singlets are privileged, i.e. if seeking to converge 5 states in total, 3 will be singlets and 2 will be triplets. - only : Only triplet states computed
