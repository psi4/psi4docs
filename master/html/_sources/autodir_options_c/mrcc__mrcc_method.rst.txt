""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      If more than one root is requested and calc=1, LR-CC (EOM-CC) calculation is performed automatically for the excited states. This overrides all automatic determination of method and will only work with :py:func:`~psi4.driver.energy`. This becomes ``CC/CI`` (option \#5) in fort.56. See Table :ref:`MRCC_METHOD <table:mrcc__mrcc_method>` for details. 

      * **Type**: integer
