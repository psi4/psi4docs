:term:`MRCC_RESTART <MRCC_RESTART (MRCC)>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      The program restarts from the previously calculated parameters if it is 1. In case it is 2, the program executes automatically the lower-level calculations of the same type consecutively (e.g., CCSD, CCSDT, and CCSDTQ if CCSDTQ is requested) and restarts each calculation from the previous one (rest=2 is available only for energy calculations). Currently, only a value of 0 and 2 are supported. This becomes ``rest`` (option \#4) in fort.56. 

      * **Type**: integer
      * **Default**: 0
