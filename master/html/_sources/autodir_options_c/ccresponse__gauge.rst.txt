:term:`GAUGE <GAUGE (CCRESPONSE)>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies the choice of representation of the electric dipole operator. For polarizability, this keyword is ignored and ``LENGTH`` gauge is computed. For optical rotation and raman optical activity, this keyword is active, and acceptable values are ``LENGTH`` for the usual length-gauge representation, ``VELOCITY``(default) for the modified velocity-gauge representation in which the static-limit optical rotation tensor is subtracted from the frequency- dependent tensor, or ``BOTH``. Note that, for optical rotation and raman optical activity calculations, only the choices of ``VELOCITY`` or ``BOTH`` will yield origin-independent results.

      * **Type**: string
      * **Possible Values**: LENGTH, VELOCITY, BOTH
      * **Default**: VELOCITY
