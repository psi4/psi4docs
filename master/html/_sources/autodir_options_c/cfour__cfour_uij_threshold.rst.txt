:term:`CFOUR_UIJ_THRESHOLD <CFOUR_UIJ_THRESHOLD (CFOUR)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies the threshold value (given as an integer) for the treatment of CPHF coefficients in second derivative calculations using perturbed canonical orbitals. If a CPHF coefficient is above the threshold, the corresponding orbital rotation is treated (at the expense of additional CPU cost) using the standard non-canonical procedures, while orbital pairs corresponding to CPHF coefficients below the threshold are treated using perturbed canonical representation. Default: 25 (Default: 1 in the developer version)

      * **Type**: integer
      * **Default**: 25
