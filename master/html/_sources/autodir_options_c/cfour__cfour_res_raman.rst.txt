      This option can be used to convert an analytically calculated gradient vector to a particular normal coordinate representation. A useful application is to calculate the gradient of an electronically excited state in the normal coordinate representation of the ground electronic state, as this provides a first approximation to resonance Raman intensities (hence the name of the keyword). Calculations that use the this option require the externally supplied force constant matrix ``FCMFINAL``, which is written to disk during the course of both analytic and finite-difference vibrational frequency calculations. No such transformation is performed if OFF (=0); while ON (=1) directs the program to evaluate the gradient and transform it to the chosen set of normal coordinates. A warning message is printed if the force constant matrix is unavailable.
