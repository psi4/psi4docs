:term:`STABILITY_ANALYSIS <STABILITY_ANALYSIS (SCF)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Whether to perform stability analysis after convergence. NONE prevents analysis being performed. CHECK will print out the analysis of the wavefunction stability at the end of the computation. FOLLOW will perform the analysis and, if a totally symmetric instability is found, will attempt to follow the eigenvector and re-run the computations to find a stable solution.

      * **Type**: string
      * **Possible Values**: NONE, CHECK, FOLLOW
      * **Default**: NONE
